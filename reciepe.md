Start with raw beans: yes you can make it with canned beans but a good rajma needs to be made with raw kidney beans.

The beans need to be soaked overnight and then pressure cooked for that soft texture which is a must for rajma.

I am sure most people who grew up around Delhi, would swear by the melt-in-mouth texture of rajma chawal (rajma and rice) being served at several food stalls across the city.

And for that texture, you need to soak the beans, there are no two ways about it.

Grate the onions or finely chop them: for that smooth curry, either grate the onions or really finely chop them.

Also when you use grated onions, it takes a little longer for them to cook for the raw smell to go away, so have patience while cooking them.

Use fresh ginger-garlic paste: again it will make a difference to the final taste of the rajma.

Cook tomatoes for a longer time: do not rush this step. After you add the tomato puree, took the tomatoes in total for around 15 minutes on medium heat before adding the kidney beans to the pan.

I know that might seem like a long time but itâ€™s important.

Simmer on low heat: so after you add the boiled kidney beans to the pan, lower the heat and let the curry simmer for 20 minutes, at the very minimum. If you have time, add an additional 10 minutes.

This simmering on low heat helps in developing the flavors and the curry tastes so much better.

Mash some of the rajma to thicken the curry: while the rajma is simmering, take a spoon (or potato masher) and mash some of the kidney beans (not all) with the back of your spoon.

This thickens the curry, gives it a texture and makes it creamier.

Touch of ghee at end: I love adding a tablespoon of ghee at the end to my rajma. It really brings the flavors together.

Sometimes, I would add fry some ginger julienne in the ghee and add to the rajma.

Tastes even better the next day: curries like rajma and chole taste even better the next day.

The beans absorb the flavors so well overnight and so the taste increases the next day.
