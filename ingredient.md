Rajma – You can use any variety of Rajma to make this Punjabi curry. I prefer using Chitra variety, as it cooks really well.

Tomatoes – We will use both finely chopped tomatoes and tomato puree to get that perfect tangy taste and the right consistency of the gravy.

Spice Powders – We will use some everyday spice powders for this authentic Punjabi Curry such as coriander powder, turmeric powder, Kashmiri red chili powder, roasted cumin powder, dry mango powder, and garam masala powder.

Oil – Use mustard oil for the authentic taste, but if you do not have the same, you can make this curry with any vegetable oil or even ghee.

Other Ingredients – Other than the above-mentioned ingredients, we will need onions, ginger garlic paste, salt, and fresh coriander
